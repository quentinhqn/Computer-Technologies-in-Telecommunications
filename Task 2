For this task we search some data.

So we use the command ping to ping google.fr and get some data we use redirection to get data in a file .txt 
I put the photo in another file. I don t know how to put some photo :)

To clean the file we can delete every letter from the file or juste with the position of everything keep the caractere that we want or we can cout the space and only keep things 
after X space 



My code:

user@user-VirtualBox:~/erasmus$ ping google.fr > ping.txt

To analyze the code I will delete useless lines using sed

user@user-VirtualBox:~/erasmus$ sed '1d' ping.csv ///delete the first line 

cat file.csv | awk -F"," {'print $3'} > required_out.csv    /// to keep only time so we have column of number 

after that he only stay time we can do a average of each line 

user@user-VirtualBox:~/erasmus$ awk 'NR>=1 && NR<=8 {S+=$1} END{print S}' <  required_out.csv    /// We got the summs of all time
252.8


Now we just have to divide by the number of value

user@user-VirtualBox:~/erasmus$ awk 'NR>=1 && NR<=8 {S+=$1} END{print S}' <  required_out.csv 
252.8


user@user-VirtualBox:~/erasmus$ awk '{print ($1)/8}' final.txt     /// So we got average of time .
31.6
